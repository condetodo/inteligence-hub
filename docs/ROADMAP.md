### End-to-End Testing (2026-03-23)
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Scope:** Full pipeline tested with real data:
  - ✅ Auth (login/register)
  - ✅ Instance CRUD
  - ✅ Input upload (text — Entrevista, Nota)
  - ✅ Processing pipeline (Corpus → Brand Voice → Content + Insights → Distribution)
  - ✅ Insights display (weekly report with executive summary, themes, opportunities)
  - ✅ Brand Voice auto-generation (all fields populated by AI agent)
  - ✅ Content generation (drafts created per platform)

### Processing Status Feedback (2026-03-26)
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Scope:** Real-time processing status with adaptive polling
  - Dashboard: RunStatusBadge on each instance card (RUNNING/COMPLETED/FAILED)
  - History: Expandable vertical stepper timeline per run (step-by-step progress)
  - Adaptive polling: 3-5s when running, 10-30s idle, auto-stop after 60s
- **Design doc:** `intelligence-hub-app/docs/plans/2026-03-26-processing-status-design.md`
- **Plan file:** `intelligence-hub-app/docs/plans/2026-03-26-processing-status-plan.md`

### Digital Twin / Knowledge Base — Phase 1 (2026-03-26)
- **Status:** COMPLETED (backend) — Frontend UI expansion pending
- **Design doc:** `docs/plans/2026-03-26-digital-twin-kb-design.md`
- **Plan file:** `docs/plans/2026-03-26-digital-twin-kb-plan.md`
- **What was implemented:**
  - ✅ Fixed Opus model ID (was pointing to Sonnet)
  - ✅ Expanded BrandVoice schema → KB with topics, contacts, narratives, lockedFields
  - ✅ Added Instance config: processingPeriod (WEEKLY/MONTHLY), activeWindow (default 8)
  - ✅ Created Distillation Agent (Opus) — replaces old BrandVoice agent, respects locked fields
  - ✅ Corpus Builder now filters inputs by period date range (not all inputs forever)
  - ✅ Orchestrator pipeline: corpus → distillation → content+insights → distribution
  - ✅ Content + Insights agents now receive full KB (profile base + active memory of last N periods)
  - ✅ Frontend step labels updated (Destilación replaces Brand Voice, backward compat kept)
  - ✅ Frontend types updated for new KB fields
  - ✅ Production DB migrated (prisma db push)
- **What's still pending (frontend UI):**
  - Brand Voice page expansion: show topics with positions, contacts, narratives
  - Lock/unlock icons on editable fields
  - Instance settings: period selector (weekly/monthly) + active window config
- **Needs testing:**
  - Run a full processing cycle to verify distillation works end-to-end
  - Verify Opus model generates quality distillation output
  - Check that locked fields are respected during processing

### Horse Workflow Evolution (2026-04-04)
- **Status:** COMPLETED (code) — Pending DB migration + E2E testing
- **Design doc:** `docs/plans/2026-04-04-horse-workflow-evolution-design.md`
- **Plan file:** `docs/plans/2026-04-04-horse-workflow-evolution-plan.md`
- **Scope:** 6 major changes to align with Horse's real workflow:
  1. **Brand Voice static/dynamic split** — Identity fields (identity, valueProposition, audience, voiceTone, positioning, metrics) are now static and protected from AI updates. KB fields (topics, contacts, narratives) remain dynamic.
  2. **Improved instance kick-off** — Wizard expanded to 6 steps: Profile → Brand Voice (manual) → Strategic Documents → Platforms → Processing → Summary
  3. **Processing modal** — Click "Procesar" opens a modal to configure content type (Thought Leadership / Hitos), milestone details, weekly directives, and platform selection
  4. **Brand Voice consistency analysis** — New Sonnet-based agent scores each draft (1-10) against the Brand Voice identity, with diversity check vs recent approved posts
  5. **Approved content benchmark** — Agents receive up to 3 diverse approved posts as few-shot examples with anti-bias instructions ("superar, no copiar")
  6. **Agent personality configuration** — Non-technical operator panel with style sliders (formal/conversacional, tecnico/accesible, conciso/detallado), free-text instructions, reference examples, and restrictions per platform
- **What was implemented:**
  - ✅ Schema: new fields on BrandVoice, InputFile, ContentOutput, ProcessingRun + new AgentPromptConfig table
  - ✅ Distillation agent respects `staticFieldsLocked`, reports suggestions via `staticSuggestions`
  - ✅ Strategic docs (STRATEGIC_DOC type, isFoundational flag, always in agent context)
  - ✅ Processing config passed through pipeline to all agents
  - ✅ Benchmark with diversity selection + approval notes
  - ✅ Consistency checker agent integrated into pipeline (new step between content and distribution)
  - ✅ Agent prompt config service + routes (GET/PUT per instance/platform)
  - ✅ Brand Voice page split into Identity + Knowledge Base tabs
  - ✅ Instance wizard expanded to 6 steps with BV manual entry + strategic docs
  - ✅ Processing modal with content types, milestone, directives, platform selection
  - ✅ Kanban enhancements: consistency badge + approval notes flow
  - ✅ Agent personality panel in settings (sliders, instructions, restrictions)
  - ✅ Strategic documents section in inputs page
  - ✅ Unified agent context: BV + KB + corpus + strategic docs + config + benchmark + style
- **Pending:**
  - Run `prisma db push` or `prisma migrate dev` on production DB
  - Full E2E testing of the complete flow
  - Verify consistency agent produces useful scores with real data

## What's Next

### Digital Twin — Phase 2: Team Operations Report
- **Status:** DESIGNED — Not yet implemented
- **Design doc:** `docs/plans/2026-03-26-digital-twin-kb-design.md` (Phase 2 section)
- **Scope:**
  - New agent generates operational report for communication team
  - Detects: position changes, new/cooling topics, new contacts, tone shifts, contradictions, opportunities
  - Editable report prompt per instance (team customizes focus)
  - New UI tab or email/Slack delivery

### Technical Debt — To Discuss

- **Data-driven maxTokens refinement** — First pass was done 2026-04-10 with calibrated values per agent based on static schema analysis (MAX_TOKENS constant in claude.ts). Should be revisited once APIUsageLog has accumulated ~20+ runs of real traffic to get p95/p99 distributions. Likely tweaks: tighten values if realistic p95 is much lower than current ceilings, loosen only if production runs actually pegging the ceiling. Data collection requires the cost tracking fix (c9dcde2) to be in prod — done.
- **Refactor agent function signatures** — `runLinkedInAgent`, `runXAgent`, `runBlogAgent`, `runTikTokAgent` all take 12+ positional parameters. Each new cross-cutting feature (humanization, style, benchmark…) adds one more. Should become a single `{ instanceId, context, config }` object with destructuring. Refactor touches orchestrator + 4 agents. Francisco wants to discuss approach (incremental vs bulk, naming of context bundle) before executing.
- **Horse Workflow E2E testing** — Code shipped 2026-04-04 but never fully tested end-to-end with real data. Need to: run full pipeline, verify consistency scores are useful (distribution between 6-9, not all 9.5), check lock fields are respected, validate benchmark diversity selection.

### Other Improvements
1. **Drag & Drop file upload** — Support real file uploads (.txt, .pdf, .docx, WhatsApp .zip exports) with multer + storage
2. **Bulk input upload** — Upload multiple inputs at once via drag & drop or multi-file selector
3. **Audio input upload** — Upload audio files (.mp3/.m4a) with automatic transcription via Whisper API
4. **Custom domain** — Connect production domain to Vercel
5. **Error handling polish** — Better user feedback for 409 (already processing), timeouts, etc.
